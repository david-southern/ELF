This 'portfolio repo' is intended to give an idea of some of the projects I have worked
on in the past.

E-L-Fun (English Language Fun) was a phonics program developed around 2008-2009 by my father-in-law, 
Floyd Sucher, who was an early childhood education professor.  The program was targeted at 1st-5th grade
children, and included full lesson curriculums.

As part of the marketing effort, Floyd wanted to create a collection of four educational games that would
help to practice and re-inforce the concepts learned during the program.  This repository includes
both the source for those games, as well as the Marketing website that I created for him.

These games represent my first (and to date, only) foray into Windows application development.  
Based upon that experience, I am glad that my focus has been on web development. :)  The website code
is a bit more interesting, as in addition to the basic marketing materials, it also included an online
purchase option, and a user metrics and management system.

I have put up a 'portfolio' version of the website at [ELF Website](http://spekisoftware.com/ELFWebsite/Default.aspx).
This version shows the main pages, however it is not backed up by a DB, or by the credit card processing account, 
so a lot of the deeper links are going to be broken.  The [Games](http://spekisoftware.com/ELFWebsite/GamesInfo.aspx)
page shows screenshots of the actual games themselves.
