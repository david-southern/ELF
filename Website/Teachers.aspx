      The ELFun Integrated Spelling and Writing Program and Phonics and Word Building Games incorporate several features that contribute to the student’s spelling, writing, and reading success.

        The Integrated Spelling / Writing Program
      </div>
      This program is a unique departure from traditional spelling and writing instruction. By integrating the two skills the students experience the more natural process of writing that contributes to retention of the spelling of words and an understanding of the writing process. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The program contains 2000 focused words that the students should spell accurately. Based on research, these 2000 words account for more than 80% of the writing used in daily written communication.</span>
      <br />
      <br />
      The ELFun Program helps students master these skills in a number of ways:
      <ul>
        <li>The passages become a reading activity: By reading the passage several times they improve their reading skills.</li>
        <li>Copying the passage: This kinesthetic/tactile activity can improve retention of the words and their awareness of sentences, capitalization and punctuation.</li>
        <li>Dictation testing: Writing words in sentences contributes to the meaning of many functional words they use so frequently and can lead to their mastery of the spelling and reading of these words.</li>
        <li>The CUPS writing activity: A team learning experience in which the students identify and correct capitalization, usage, punctuation and spelling errors each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morning. Cooperative and team learning activities help the children learn the content as well as learn how to learn. </li>
        <li>The writing activities: These activities introduce the six important writing skills and provide experiences for improving their writing ability. The extended writing projects incorporate life skills with writing and presenting skills.</li>
        <li>Extended writing projects: The basic program provides for thirty weeks of instruction. Included at the end of every fifth week is a project that can take from one to four weeks. They provide opportunities to apply the important life skills essential to success in life. </li>
      </ul>
