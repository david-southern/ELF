        Parent Power 1 - What is phonics?
      </h1>
Nearly everyone has heard that it is important for children to learn phonics skills. Phonics skills provide tools that can lead children to independence in reading, spelling and writing. But what is Phonics? <br />
<br />
Simply stated, phonics is the ability to see letters and recall the correct sounds associated with the different individual letters or some combinations of letters such as sh, ch, and others. To do this the learner must develop four specific skills:<br />
<br />
      <br />
      <ol style="margin: 0">
        <li><strong>The first skill</strong> is <strong>letter identification</strong>  which is probably the easiest step. The learner must recognize and distinguish between the twenty-six letters of the alphabet. Visually they must be able to match lower case forms (s to s,  r to r and so on ) that are the same  and know how they are different from other similar letters (b from d, p from g, h from k ). Eventually they need to recognize both the lower case and upper case  forms (r – R, g – G ) of each letter. Though not essential, knowing the name of each letter helps in handling the learning process. Some prefer to name each letter by its initial sound. Ways to help children learn are included in the ELFun Phonics Games. Additional ways will be described in a later article. (See <strong>Tic-Tac-Gold&trade;</strong> – letter match)</li>
        <li><strong>The second skill</strong> is perhaps the most difficult to develop. It is called <strong>phoneme perception</strong> which means the ability to hear the individual sound for each letter or combination of letters. Learning to speak is undoubtedly one of the great miracles of early childhood. Though at an early age they may repeat a single sound such as m-m-m, b-b-b, it is by mimicking what they hear that they learn to speak complete words. They discover words give them great power whereas individual sounds accomplish little. The phonics process requires they tune their ears <strong>to hear and isolate those sounds</strong> and distinguish between those that are very similar (ch – sh). <br />
          <br />
          Children learn to speak by watching our lips, tongue, teeth and mouth positions. Because many sounds are made with very similar positions, the miracle of speech is even more amazing. For example the following groups of letters have very similar articulated (mouth) positions: m, b and p; d, t and n; k, g, and ng; f and v; s and z and others. Because of this, care should be given when helping children develop phonemic perception. To avoid confusion, the sounds that use the same mouth positions should not initially be practiced at the same time.<br />
          <br>
          The earliest experimentation can be <strong> matching pictures</strong> that begin with the same sound:  bat, bear, bed, bus, bee or cat, cow, cake, coat, cup. More activities will be provided in a later blog. (See <strong>Super Sonic Phonics&trade; / Tic-Tac-Gold&trade; picture to picture games</strong>)</li>
        <li><strong>The third skill</strong> in phonics is <strong>connecting the individual sounds with the correct letter or letters</strong>.  At this point the learner discovers which letters represent the different sounds for the consonants: b is the letter for the sound you hear at the beginning of bed, ball, box, boat: f  for fish, fan, foot, farm.  The sounds for the vowels vary, are more complicated and usually are learned after the child has some proficiency in the consonants. (See <strong>Vowel Howl&trade;, Super Sonic Phonics&trade; and Tic-Tac-Gold&trade;</strong>)</li>
        <li><strong>A fourth skill</strong> is <strong>combining individual letters</strong>  to form complete words. Beginning activities in blending include what is called substitution. A single consonant letter and sound is blended with familiar endings to form words. The letter b is combined with ed, at, all, ill, and ig, or substitute the first letter - bat, cat, fat, hat, mat, rat, sat. (See <strong>Genius Word Builder&trade;</strong>)</li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      Two final points:<br />
      The four ELFun games, <strong>Tic-Tac-Gold&trade;, Super Sonic Phonics&trade;, Vowel Howl&trade;</strong> and <strong>Genius Word Builder&trade;</strong> provide practice in the four steps described above. The small speaker displayed with each picture and letter is an important part of the learning process. By clicking on the speaker the learner can hear the pronunciation of the picture and letter names as well as the sound for each consonant and vowel.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Hearing many simple stories read orally</strong> over and over by a parent or sibling can lead to a natural process of integrating phonics into the child’s acquisition of the skill. An equally important benefit is the bonding between the child and important people in her or his life as they sit close together. Techniques for developing phonics and thinking while reading orally will be discussed in a later article. <br>
