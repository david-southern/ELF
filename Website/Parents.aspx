      During the first five years of a child's life parents lay the foundations that shape the future of each child. Beginning at birth the daily interactions between parents and children help them discover who they are, what they know and what they might become. Very rapidly, they develop the ability to walk and talk, to physically manipulate and use their environment. They discover the meaning of love and expand their intellectual ability. They form attitudes, beliefs and feelings that will determine how they meet the experiences of life and handle them.

      The games offered on this website are designed to help young children develop the basic phonics skills essential to success in reading, spelling, and writing. Developing phonics skills passes through four steps:
      <ol>
        <li>Visual Perception - learning to identify and distinguish between the letters of the alphabet in both the lower and capital forms. Super Sonic Phonics&trade; and Tic-Tac-Gold&trade; provide activities to develop these skills.</li>
        <li>Auditory Perception - learning to hear the individual sounds each letter can produce. The games of Super Sonic Phonics&trade;, Tic-Tac-Gold&trade;, and Vowel Howl&trade; help children learn to hear and distinguish the sounds of the consonants and the vowels.</li>
        <li>Phonics - learning to associate the letters with the correct sound. Super Sonic Phonics&trade;, Tic-Tac-Gold&trade;, and Vowel Howl&trade; help students to master this ability.</li>
        <li>Blending - learning to blend letters and sounds into words. Genius Word Builder&trade; provides practice in blending at a beginning level for ages 6-8.  The intermediate level is timed and includes more blends for ages 8-10.  The advanced level is intended for ages 10-adult.</li>
      </ol>
