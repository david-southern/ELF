        ELFun Phonics and Word Building Games

      These phonics and word building games contain several techniques that have proven successful with both beginning and advanced students
      <ul>
        <li>Sound and Name Prompts: Each picture and letter in the game has a small speaker symbol near the letter or pictures. By clicking on the speaker symbol the names of each picture or letter is pronounced. In this way the learner discovers the name of more than 200 pictures and all of the letters.</li>
        <li>Repetition: By repeatedly clicking the speaker symbol many students will learn the correct pronunciation of each item. Repeated pronunciations can cue the student to the beginning sound. This is further reinforced by discovering other pictures with the same beginning sound. The same process can be followed to learn the various sounds of the vowels. </li>
        <li>Immediate Feedback: As the student makes a choice, he or she receives an immediate signal whether it is correct or wrong. In order to encourage exploration, they are always allowed to continue with other choices until they arrive at the correct answer.</li>
        <li>Varied Time: Time to complete each match in some of the games varies according to the level of the student. As they become proficient they can move to a faster level.</li>
      </ul>

        The Integrated Spelling and Writing Program
      </div>
      This program also has several unique features that can help the ELL and Title I student. The passages are built around 2000 focused words between level one and six that account for more than 80% of the writing used in daily written communication. The most frequently used words appear repeatedly from level to level to ensure mastery of the highest used words.
      <ul>
        <li>Integrated spelling and writing: Rather than a traditional list approach to teaching spelling the new (focused) spelling words are imbedded in a passage. These passages give meaning to the words which helps retention of the word.</li>
        <li>The passages become a reading activity. Reading the passage several times improves reading skills.</li>
        <li>Copying the passage: This kinesthetic/tactile activity can improve retention of the words and awareness of sentences, capitalization and punctuation.</li>
        <li>Dictation testing: Writing words in sentences contributes to the meaning of the many functional words used so frequently and can lead to mastery of the spelling and reading of these words.</li>
        <li>The CUPS writing activity: A team learning experience in which the students identify and correct capitalization, usage, punctuation and spelling errors each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morning. Cooperative and team learning activities help the children learn the content as well as learn how to learn. </li>
      </ul>
